🛠️ Technical Skills



* Microcontrollers: Arduino (Uno, Nano, Mega).
* Languages: C++, Arduino Sketch.
* Concepts: PWM (Pulse Width Modulation), 
* Serial Communication, 
* Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC)
* Sensor Calibration.



#### 📡 Sensors (The "Senses")



* Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04): Used for distance measurement and obstacle avoidance.



* LDR (Light Dependent Resistor): Detects light intensity; often used for automatic night lamps or street light projects.



* Sound Detection Sensor: A microphone module used to detect claps or loud noises to trigger actions.



* Infrared (IR) Sensor: Used for line-following robots or detecting nearby objects.



* DHT11 Sensor: Measures both temperature and humidity levels in the environment.



* PIR Motion Sensor: Detects movement within a room, commonly used in security system projects.



* Potentiometer: A variable resistor used as an analog input to control things like LED brightness or servo position.



#### ⚙️ Actuators (The "Movement \& Output")

* Servo Motor (SG90): Provides precise control of angular position (0–180°); used for robot arms or automatic doors.



* DC Motors \& L298N Motor Driver: Used to drive the wheels of your DIVE robotics car.



* Piezo Buzzer: Produces tones or alarm sounds when a sensor is triggered.



* RGB LED Module: A single LED that can mix red, green, and blue light to create millions of colors.



* Traffic Signal Module: A pre-built module with Red, Yellow, and Green LEDs for simulating traffic lights.



* LCD Display (16x2): Used to display text data, such as distance readings or temperature.



#### 🔌 Supporting Tools (The "Foundation")



* Arduino UNO Rev3: The microcontroller "brain" that coordinates all other parts.



* Breadboard: A solderless base used to build and test your circuits quickly.



* Jumper Wires (Male-to-Male \& Male-to-Female): Essential for connecting components to the Arduino.



* Push Buttons: Used for digital inputs, like starting a robot or toggling an LED.



* Resistors: Crucial for limiting current flow and protecting your LEDs from burning out.
